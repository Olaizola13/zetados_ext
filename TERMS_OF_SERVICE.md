# ZetaDos Terms of Service
Last updated: 2025-12-16

These terms describe how you can use ZetaDos and what you can expect from us.

## What ZetaDos does
- We help people plan, host, and join sports meetups. We connect participants but do not run the physical events.

## Eligibility and accounts
- You must be at least 16 or meet your local age requirement.
- Keep your account info accurate and secure. We may suspend accounts that risk user safety or break these terms.

## Respectful use
- Share only content you have the right to share.
- No harassment, fraud, dangerous behavior, or illegal activity.

## Events, safety, and disputes
- Hosts own their event details and safety decisions. Join only if the plan works for you.
- Attendance and payment disputes follow the in-app workflow; repeated submissions without new information are not allowed.
- ZetaDos does not supervise events and is not liable for the conduct of participants or conditions on site.

## Assumption of risk
- Physical activities involve risk. You are responsible for your health, equipment, and compliance with local laws and venue rules.

## Location and privacy summary
- We use precise location when you enable it to match you with nearby events. When hosts choose to hide exact locations, others see only an approximate area until close to start time. See the Privacy Policy for details.

## Content and rights
- You keep ownership of your content but give us permission to store, display, and share it as needed to operate ZetaDos.
- Do not post content that infringes others' rights.

## Changes and availability
- We may add, change, or remove features to keep the service reliable and secure. We will give notice when practical.

## Disclaimers and limits of liability
- ZetaDos is provided "as is" without warranties.
- We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Where allowed, our total liability is limited to the amount you paid us in the last 12 months (or EUR 50, whichever is greater).

## Ending use
- You can stop using ZetaDos anytime. We may suspend or terminate accounts that break these terms or create safety/legal risk.

## Governing law
- Subject to mandatory consumer protections, these terms are governed by Spanish law, and disputes go to the competent courts in Spain unless your local consumer law requires otherwise.
