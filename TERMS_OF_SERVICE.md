# ZetaDos Terms of Service
Last updated: 2025-12-17

## Preamble and scope
- ZetaDos is a coordination tool, not an event organizer. We provide a platform for athletes to connect, but we do not supervise or control any activity.
- MVP scope: only athlete profiles are available. No payments, subscriptions, advertisements, merchants, shop pins, or other commerce features are enabled.
- You are responsible for your preparation, equipment, and compliance with local laws and venue rules.

## Venue and responsibility
- ZetaDos only provides digital infrastructure to connect users and share routes. We do not supervise, approve, control, or attend events created through the app.
- The event creator is solely responsible for safety planning, route selection, legality of the activity, and venue access.
- Users participate at their own risk; ZetaDos does not guarantee safety, attendance, or the suitability of any route or venue.

## Death and injury waiver
- Activities found via ZetaDos may involve traffic accidents, collisions or falls, bad weather, environmental hazards, equipment failure, and health episodes (including cardiac events or dehydration).
- By using ZetaDos you waive and release ZetaDos and its developers from claims for injury, death, property damage, or losses arising from events you create, join, or attend.

## Accuracy disclaimer
- GPS, map, elevation, and distance data in the app are estimates for recreational use only.
- Do not rely on ZetaDos for safety-critical navigation or emergency response.

## Automated safety controls and right to appeal
- Safety controls rely on automated reputation/karma signals and abuse detection to limit access when risk is detected.
- If your access is restricted by these automated systems, you may appeal by emailing **hoysoloz2@gmail.com** with supporting evidence; every appeal receives human review.

## Data handling and 30-day safety hold
- Account deletion requests trigger a 30-day retention window to protect community safety and preserve evidence. Data is not publicly accessible during this hold.
- After the hold, personal data (including location history and event participation identifiers) is permanently deleted or irreversibly anonymized. See the Privacy Policy for details.

## Conduct and account actions
- No harassment, fraud, or dangerous behavior. Accounts may be restricted or removed when safety is at risk or rules are broken.

## Export controls
- You may not use ZetaDos from sanctioned or embargoed regions (currently IR, KP, SY, CU, RU, BY) or if you appear on restricted parties lists. Access from those regions is blocked.

## Governing law and venue
- These terms are governed by the laws of Spain, with exclusive venue and jurisdiction in the courts of Madrid, Spain.
