# ZetaDos Privacy Policy
Last updated: 2025-12-01

This policy explains how ZetaDos collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile apps, APIs, and related services (the "Services"). By using the Services you agree to this policy.

## What we collect
- **Account and profile data**: name, email, profile details, photos, preferences, and settings.
- **Authentication data**: tokens from sign-in providers (for example, Google Sign-In) and session identifiers. Plain-text passwords are not stored.
- **Usage and content**: event metadata, invitations, confirmations, cancellations, feedback, chat messages, and files you intentionally upload or share.
- **Device and app diagnostics**: device identifiers, OS/version, app version, crash reports, performance metrics, and limited log data to operate and secure the Services.
- **Location data**: precise or approximate location when you enable location features (e.g., maps, check-ins, routing) and consent in your device settings.
- **Notifications data**: push notification tokens to deliver alerts and reminders.
- **Third-party integrations**: data you authorize us to access from connected services (e.g., Strava activity data) and related tokens to keep the connection active.

## How we use data
- Provide and improve the Services, including event workflows, navigation/maps, messaging, recommendations, and safety/anti-abuse checks.
- Authenticate users, maintain sessions, and remember preferences.
- Send transactional communications (invites, confirmations, reminders) and, where permitted, product updates.
- Monitor performance, debug issues, and protect against fraud, abuse, or security threats.
- Fulfill legal obligations and enforce our terms.

## Legal bases (where applicable)
- To perform our contract with you (deliver core app features).
- With your consent (e.g., location sharing, optional integrations such as Strava, certain notifications).
- For legitimate interests (security, service reliability, analytics), balanced against your rights.
- To comply with legal obligations.

## Sharing and processors
- **Service providers**: cloud hosting, analytics, crash reporting, messaging, authentication, and performance monitoring (including Firebase services), as well as map/places providers (e.g., Google Maps).
- **Integration partners**: only with your authorization (e.g., Strava tokens and activity data) and only to provide the connected feature.
- **Compliance and safety**: to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, or protect rights, property, and safety.
We do not sell personal data.

## Data storage and retention
- Data is stored in secure cloud infrastructure and transmitted over TLS.
- Sensitive tokens on device are stored using secure storage mechanisms.
- We retain data while your account is active and as needed to deliver the Services, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, or comply with legal obligations. When you request deletion, we remove or anonymize data unless retention is legally required.

## Your choices and rights
- **Access, correction, deletion**: request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data.
- **Delete account**: email hoysolozetados@gmail.com from the address tied to your account with the subject “Delete my ZetaDos account.” Account deletion removes or anonymizes personal data unless retention is required by law.
- **Consent controls**: enable/disable location access and notifications in your device settings; disconnect integrations (e.g., Strava) at any time.
- **Portability and objection**: where applicable, request a copy of your data or object to certain processing.
- **Marketing**: opt out of non-essential communications using in-app settings or provided unsubscribe mechanisms.
To exercise rights or make privacy requests, use the contact details below.

## International data transfers
Data may be processed in countries other than your own. We rely on appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses where applicable) to protect your information.

## Security
We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect data, including encryption in transit, scoped access controls, and monitoring for abuse. No system is perfectly secure; please report suspected issues promptly.

## Children
The Services are not directed to children under 16 (or the age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect data from children in that age group. If you believe we have done so, contact us to delete the data.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes to our practices or legal requirements. Material changes will be communicated through the app or our website. Continued use after changes become effective means you accept the updated policy.

## Contact
For questions or requests about this policy or your data, email **hoysolozetados@gmail.com**.
