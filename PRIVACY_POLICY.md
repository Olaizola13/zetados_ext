# ZetaDos Privacy Policy
Last updated: 2025-12-17

## MVP scope and processors
- Only athlete profiles are enabled. There are no payments, subscriptions, ads, merchants, or shop features, and no payment processors are active.
- Core processors: Firebase/Google Cloud for hosting/auth/messaging and Google Maps for location services.

## Data we collect (data minimization)
- Contact info and profile details you provide (name, email, preferences, consent choices).
- Location data when you enable it for discovery or meetups.
- Activity statistics and safety signals (events you create/join, invites/chats, feedback/karma).
- Device identifiers and diagnostic data for security and reliability.

## Legal bases (GDPR)
- Contractual necessity: operate your account, invitations, chats, and event coordination.
- Legitimate interest: fraud prevention, abuse detection, and safety scoring (karma).
- Consent: precise location, health/fitness data (for example, running/cycling levels or future heart-rate signals), and marketing/analytics toggles. You can withdraw consent at any time in Settings or via device controls.

## How we use data
- Operate and secure the product: authentication, invitations, reminders, confirmations, and safety workflows.
- Communications: transactional notices about events and product updates; no advertising or sale of personal data.
- Derive safety/reputation scores to protect participants.

## Sharing
- Service providers supporting hosting, messaging, analytics, and maps.
- People you interact with (for example, event participants) based on your actions.
- Legal/safety disclosures when required. We do not sell personal data.

## Retention and 30-day safety hold
- Data is retained while your account is active.
- Deletion requests trigger a 30-day safety hold to investigate fraud/safety issues; data is not publicly accessible during this hold.
- After the hold, personal data (including location history and event participation identifiers) is permanently deleted or irreversibly anonymized. Backups age out through normal rotation.

## Automated decisions and your right to appeal
- Safety controls rely on automated reputation/karma and abuse signals. You can appeal significant automated decisions (such as bans or access restrictions) by emailing the Data Protection Officer at **hoysolozona2@gmail.com** with context; a human review is guaranteed.

## Your choices and rights
- Access, correct, delete, or export your data.
- Control marketing/analytics toggles, revoke location access, and withdraw consent for health/fitness processing at any time.
- Contact the DPO at **hoysolozona2@gmail.com** for privacy requests or appeals.

## Export control notice
- By using ZetaDos, you confirm you are not located in a sanctioned jurisdiction (including IR, KP, SY, CU, RU, BY) and are not on a denied parties list. Access from sanctioned regions is blocked.
