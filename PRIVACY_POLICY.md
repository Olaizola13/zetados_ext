# ZetaDos Privacy Policy
Last updated: 2025-12-16

We wrote this in plain language so you can see what we do with your data and the choices you have.

## What this policy covers
This policy explains the information we collect when you use ZetaDos, how we use and share it, and how you can control it.

## Information we collect
- Account details: name, email, profile photo, preferences, and consent choices.
- Activity details: events you create or join (title, schedule, sport, optional location), routes you upload, messages you send.
- Location (when you allow it): GPS data to show nearby events or set meeting points.
- Device and usage data: app version, device type, and diagnostics to keep things running.
- Safety signals: reports, feedback, and reputation data to protect the community.
- Integrations you connect: data you choose to share from partners (for example, fitness services) and the tokens needed to keep them connected.

## How we use information
- Run the app: sign-in, invitations, reminders, confirmations, and dispute handling.
- Make ZetaDos useful: show relevant events, people, and routes based on your settings.
- Communicate: send transactional messages about events and updates; optional marketing only if you opt in.
- Safety and integrity: detect fraud/abuse and enforce our rules.
- Legal: meet legal duties and respond to lawful requests.

## When we share information
- Service providers that help us run the app (hosting, messaging, analytics, storage, maps).
- People you interact with, such as event participants and your approved contacts.
- Compliance and safety situations when law or safety requires it.
- We do not sell your personal data.

## Location handling
- Exact location is used only when you turn on location features.
- If an event hides its exact spot, we show others an approximate pin and radius instead of the exact coordinates.
- You can turn off location in your device settings or in-app consent controls at any time.

## Retention and deletion
- We keep data while your account is active and as needed for operations, security, disputes, and legal requirements.
- When you delete your account, we remove or anonymize data unless law or ongoing disputes require us to keep specific records.

## Your choices and rights
- Access, correct, delete, or export your data.
- Control marketing/analytics toggles and revoke location access in device settings.
- Disconnect integrations whenever you like.
- Contact us at **hoysoloz2@gmail.com** or use Settings > Data & Privacy in the app to make requests.

## Security
- We use encryption in transit, access controls, and monitoring. No system is perfect; report issues if you see them.

## Children
- ZetaDos is for people 16 and older (or the local age of consent). Tell us if a child used the service so we can remove the data.

## Changes to this policy
- If we update this policy, we will post the new version in the app. Continuing to use ZetaDos after changes means you accept the updated policy.
