# ZetaDos Privacy Policy (Public Mirror)

This folder is a public-ready mirror of the privacy policy. Only include non-sensitive docs here.

## Files
- PRIVACY_POLICY.md
- DELETE_ACCOUNT.md

## How to publish
1. Create a new public repo and copy these files, or run:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add privacy policy"
   git remote add origin <YOUR_PUBLIC_REPO_URL>
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. (Optional) Enable GitHub Pages (Pages > Source: deploy from branch) to serve these docs publicly; update the policy with the hosted URL once you have it.
3. Link to the published URL from the app/website legal surfaces when available.

Keep the source of truth in `docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md` and re-copy when it changes.
